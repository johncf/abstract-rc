# Generic RC

This repo explores a way to abstract over `Rc<T>` and `Arc<T>` using the
(limited?) capabilities of Rust as it exists at the time of writing this.

The idea is short and simple, that an extra page of description is unnecessary.
So please head over to [`src/lib.rs`](./src/lib.rs) to read the code and
comments.
